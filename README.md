# Digital-Clock-Project
This is a digital clock built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It displays the current time in a 12-hour format. The clock updates every second to show the live time.

Features
Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
Automatically updates every second.
Shows time in a 12-hour format with leading zeroes for single digits.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the clock display.
CSS: Styling for a clean and modern digital clock look.
JavaScript: Handles real-time time updates and 12-hour format conversion.

How It Works
The clock uses the JavaScript Date() object to get the current time.
Hours are converted from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
The time updates every second using the setInterval() method.
